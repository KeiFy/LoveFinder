A app written for Aline, my girlfriend.

Description:
Mainly realizing the function of function each other on the google map and leave some message so that we can see each other's words. This app is not written in a very good MVC model, so the extensibility is probably not good enough for continuous development, but this is a app with great memory since my girlfriend and I are in long distance. 

I will keep updating this app
